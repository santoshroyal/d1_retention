"""TEMPLATE for a new tool. Copy this file, rename it, and edit the marked sections.

How to use this file:
    1. Copy this file to a new name in the same folder. Use lower_snake_case.
       Example: `cp tools/_TEMPLATE.py tools/compute_deeplink_share.py`
    2. Edit ONLY the lines marked `# EDIT THIS`.
    3. Leave the lines marked `# LEAVE AS-IS` alone.
    4. Save. Run `./tune --verify` to confirm the new tool registered cleanly.
    5. Re-run `python scripts/generate_catalog.py` so the new tool gets a card in
       `reference/primitives.md`. Now you can reference it from the playbook prose.

This file is skipped by the MCP aggregator because its name starts with `_`.
That means copying it is safe — your *new* file (without a leading `_`) is
the one that registers as a tool.

    if err:

    # EDIT THIS — the actual calculation. This is where the math lives.
    # Use the helpers from tools._common rather than raw pandas:
    #
    #   rows = get_rows(platform=..., acquisition_source=..., date_from=..., date_to=...)
    #     → returns a DataFrame slice you can read.
    #
    #   total = aggregate(rows, "<column>", "sum" | "mean" | "median" | "count" | "min" | "max")
    #     → one number across the rows. Returns None if no numeric data.
    #
    #   rate = cohort_rate(rows, users_col="d1_users", installs_col="d1_installs")
    #     → cohort-aggregated retention rate (the methodology-correct way for
    #       weekly / monthly retention). Returns a fraction like 0.276.
    #
    #   delta = delta_pp(today_value, baseline_value)
    #     → percentage-point delta, both inputs as fractions (0.293, not 29.3).
    #
    #   trailing = filter_window(rows, end_date="2026-04-15", days=7)
    #     → rows in the trailing window ending on end_date.
    #
    # Worked example (delete this block once you have your real math):
    rows = get_rows(
        platform=platform,
        acquisition_source=acquisition_source,
        date_from=date,
        date_to=date,
    )
    if rows.empty:
        return {
            "ok": False,
            "error": f"no row for {date} on {platform}/{acquisition_source}",
        }
    your_metric_value = aggregate(rows, "dau", "sum")
    if your_metric_value is None:
        return {"ok": False, "error": f"value missing on {date}"}

    # EDIT THIS — the dict you return. Keep keys consistent with other tools:
    #   - Always include "ok": True.
    #   - Always echo the inputs (date, platform, acquisition_source) so the
    #     LLM can see what you computed it for.
    #   - Round numbers sensibly: 6 decimals for fractions, 2 for percentages,
    #     3 for ratios, 0 for integer counts.
    return {
        "ok": True,
        "date": date,
        "platform": platform,
        "acquisition_source": acquisition_source,
        "your_metric_value": round(float(your_metric_value), 2),
    }


# Tips you may want to keep in mind:
#
# - When you need help-functions that don't exist yet (like a new aggregation
#   or a new filter), fill out reference/request.md rather than
#   adding pandas calls here. The engineer will add a helper to _common.py and
#   you can use it cleanly.
#
# - Test your tool standalone before referencing it from the playbook:
#       uv run python -c "from tools.<your_file> import <your_function>; \
#                         print(<your_function>('2026-04-01', 'android', 'organic'))"
#
# - Run `./tune --verify` whenever you change your tool. It catches typos
#   without spending money on an LLM run.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONVENTIONS for surfacing weak data in your return shape
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These conventions emerged from real failure modes. Follow them when your
# tool's shape matches the pattern. The LLM is instructed (in the playbook
# and CLAUDE.md) to read these specific fields, so naming matters.
#
# 1. PARTIAL-WINDOW FLAG (for windowed computations)
#
#    If your tool computes over a window of N days but only n < N days have
#    data, return the result anyway but add:
#        "partial_window": True,
#        "coverage_pct": round(n / N * 100.0, 1),
#    This lets the LLM weaken its severity verdict instead of citing a
#    confident number on a noisy baseline. See compute_rolling_average.py
#    for the live example. compare_to_baseline.py propagates the same flag
#    into baseline_meta.partial_window.
#
# 2. SIGNAL_ERRORS DICT (for multi-signal tools)
#
#    If your tool returns several signals in one response and any individual
#    signal can fail to compute, do not use a None-in-the-signals-dict to
#    represent failure — that collapses "did not move" with "could not
#    compute". Instead, return:
#        "signals": {"signal_a": value_or_None, "signal_b": ...},
#        "signal_errors": {},   # populated per failure: {"signal_a": "reason"}
#    The LLM is told (in the playbook) to check signal_errors before
#    claiming a signal is "flat". See compute_signals_for_day.py.
#
# 3. DICTIONARY BUNDLING (for tools that read a registered sheet)
#
#    If your tool reads a non-primary registered sheet, include the sheet's
#    dictionary content in your response so the LLM has column-level
#    semantics in the same payload as the data:
#        "dictionary_path": "dict/<sheet>.md",
#        "dictionary_md": <file content>,
#    The primary sheet's dictionary is in the prompt at preflight, so
#    primary-sheet tools should NOT bundle (would double-cost tokens).
#    See get_rows.py — it uses a per-process cache so the dictionary is
#    read from disk at most once per ./tune invocation.
#
# 4. ALWAYS ECHO INPUTS
#
#    Every success return includes the exact arguments the LLM passed in
#    (date, platform, acquisition_source). The LLM cites these in the
#    report; the user uses them to verify the tool computed the right
#    cohort / segment. See any compute_*.py for examples.
