"""Tool: get_rows — fetch raw daily rows for a chosen segment and date window.

This is the LLM's escape hatch when the question is "show me the data" rather
than "compute one number." It pulls a slice of the retention sheet by
platform / acquisition_source / date window, with opinionated defaults so the
LLM cannot accidentally pull the whole sheet.

Constraints baked in:
  - 30-day default window if no dates / days are passed.
  - 400-row hard cap; the tool refuses larger pulls with a hint to narrow.
  - Standard 11-column projection by default; the LLM has to name extra
    columns explicitly.
