<!-- desc: Indian public holidays in the data window — explains expected D1 dips on family-festival days -->
# Indian public holidays — Aug 2025 to Apr 2026

This file lists the major public holidays in India that fall inside the
window of `sheets/app_health_daily.csv` (data starts 2025-05-01). Use it when
interpreting D1 dips that fall on or near these dates — holidays often:

- Compress news consumption: people are home with family, attention is on
  TV / WhatsApp / live streams instead of news apps.
- Shift the install mix: festival-driven traffic skews toward casual users
  who don't return.
- Drive lighter push engagement: editorial teams send fewer alerts; users
  open fewer.

A D1 dip on a holiday date is usually expected, not a regression.

## Confident dates (fixed every year)

## How to use this file

If a flagged dip date matches a row above, mention the holiday in the
"Caveats" section of the report and discount the dip from any structural
verdict. If the dip is *much* larger than what holidays usually cause
(say D1 down 30%+ vs trailing mean), call it out as still notable.
